# PlexComskip
My take on the PlexComskip scripts

Added check to see if HandBrakeCLI is running.  If so the script will wait until it is not running. This prevents the server from being overloaded. 

Also changed the handbrake profiles I was using.   Some shows I don't really care about I record at lower settings.
